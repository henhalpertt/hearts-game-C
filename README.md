## Rules of the Game:<br><br>

Hearts is a trick taking game that requires 4 players and a standard 52 playing card deck with Aces high and 2â€™s low.<br>
The objective of the game is to have the fewest points when someone reaches 100 points.<br>

Each turn starts with one player playing a single card, also called leading.<br>
The suit of that card determines the suit of the trick. The other players then play one card each.<br>
If they have a card in the same suit as the first card then they must play that.<br>
If they don't then they can play one of their other cards. Once four cards have been played,<br>
the player who played the highest ranking card in the original suit takes the trick,<br>
i.e. he takes the four cards on the table and he then starts the next turn.<br>
Any penalty cards in the trick (hearts or queen of spades) are added to the players penalty score.<br>
So you want to avoid taking any tricks that have hearts or the queen of spades.<br>

You cannot lead a trick with hearts, until hearts has been broken (played on another suit).<br>
So if it is your turn to lead and no heart has been played yet then you may not select a heart as the card to play first.<br>
In some variations of the game you can't play the queen of spades until hearts has been broken as well,<br>
but in this version you can always play the queen of spades and she doesn't break hearts.<br>
